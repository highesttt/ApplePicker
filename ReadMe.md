Apple Picker

## Done by [Highest](https://github.com/highesttt)

This project was done as part of CS 382 @ SIUE <br>
Simple ApplePicker game: <br>
  - You have 4 lives, 4 baskets that you control with your mouse.
  - There are 4 rounds that increasingly get harder and harder (100 points, 25 per round, to win)
  - The tree randomly moves from left to right at increasing speeds
  - Avoid the sticks! They make you lose immediately.
  - Miss an apple, you lose a life. Lose all 4 lives, it's Game Over.
